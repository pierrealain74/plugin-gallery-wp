## About

This is a WordPress plugin that creates a stunning carousel of post thumbnails. Based on OWL.js, this jQuery plugin provides swipe and drag functionalities. It is responsive and utilizes CSS3.

You can choose which thumbnails to display in the admin panel or leave it to the default setting (all thumbnails are shown, with a maximum of 15). Configure the template to determine how the carousel appears on your page (currently limited to the homepage).
